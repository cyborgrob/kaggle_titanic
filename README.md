# Kaggle Titanic Project
This is the famous Kaggle Titanic project, an open project on Kaggle with a rolling leaderboard designed as an introductory machine learning exercise: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview

This is my attempt at the task. I attempted to create this model on my own after taking a brief introductory course from Zero to Mastery. It was my first attempt at a project on my own not following a tutorial. My results scored a 78.5% accuracy which placed around 2,500th on the leaderboard of about 15,000 as of January 2024. Once I have improved my skills, I intend to revisit the project and, if not completely re-do it, at least identify how it can improved and do some minor testing.
